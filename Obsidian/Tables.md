## Create a Table

```md
| Column1  | Column2   |
|----------|-----------|
| Header1  | Header2   |
| Text1    | Text2     |
```

That's how you create a Table in md. But this is quite anoying to write so for that exists a community plugin in Obsidian that does this for you:

![[advanced_tables_tool.png]]
With this you'll be able to add, remove or move coloums and rows.
